# Share trade calculations for Australian tax returns

This repository contains code and notebooks to produce the information you need to calculate your CGT (capital gains tax) events for the ATO, based off the csv reports exported from Sharesies (or [in future] other share trading platforms).

There are also [will be] notebooks to create visualisations related to your share portfolio.
